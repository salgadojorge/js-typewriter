# Overview #

JS Typewriter simulates a user typing on a web page. Keystrokes are separated by a randomized, configurable delay that is sampled randomly. A caret may be displayed, and the caret can flash on and off. Callbacks can be used to trigger actions after each keystroke and/or trigger an action after a block of text has been displayed.

There is also a simple system for putting together more elaborate animations. See the examples below for more ideas.

# Example 1: Basic #

Getting started is very easy!

Instantiate a `Typewriter` on an element in your page. In this case, I'm using a paragraph with the ID "typewriter". `Typewriter` supports both jQuery objects (seen here) and plain old DOM objects. Next, tell the `Typewriter` what text to display.

```javascript
var typewriter = new Typewriter($("#typewriter"));
typewriter.typeText("Hello, world! This is a test... This is only a test.");
```

The complete source for [Example 1](./example1-basic/index.html) is included in this repository.

# Example 2: Terminal #

[View Example 2 Demo…](https://rawgit.com/salgadojorge/js-typewriter/master/example2-terminal/index.html)

This example shows how to construct a more elaborate series of animations by simulating a terminal.

First, we will construct the `Typewriter` and configure a custom caret and custom timing. You can view this code in [example2-terminal/index.html](./example2-terminal/index.html).

```javascript
var typewriter = new Typewriter($("#terminal"));
typewriter.setCaret("_");
typewriter.setCaretPeriod(500);
typewriter.setDelay(100, 50);
animate(typewriter);
```

As in the previous example, we commence by constructing a new Typewriter and attaching it to a `<p>` with the ID "terminal". This page has some CSS to make it look something like an old-fashioned, VT-100 terminal, but the styling has no effect on the operation of the script.

Next we customize the caret. The caret will be an underscore character `_` instead of the default pipe character `|`. The caret will be alternately displayed for 500ms and then hidden for 500ms.

Then we set the keystroke delay to average 100ms between keystrokes with up to 50ms random variance. So between each keystroke, there will be a random delay between 50ms and 150ms.

The last line calls an animation function that is defined in [example2-terminal/animate.js](./example2-terminal/animate.js). Let's take a look at that file.

```javascript
function animate(typewriter) {
    sequence = [
        {
            text: "trinity@localhost:~$ ",
            instant: true,
            delayAfter: 500
        },
        {
            text: "whoami\n",
            delayAfter: 500
        },
        {
            text: "trinity@the-matrix.net\ntrinity@localhost:~$ ",
            instant: true,
            delayAfter: 500
        },
        {
            text: "scp root@192.168.54.99:rickastley.mp4\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\bvirus.tgz .\n",
            delayAfter: 1000,
            callback: function () {console.log("Hehe... joke.")}
        },
        ...
    ];

    typewriter.playSequence(sequence);
```

This file declares a sequence of animation steps. Each step can display some text, run a callback after the text is displayed, and then delay a bit before running the next step.

For example, the first step displays some text that looks like a shell prompt. We set the `instant` boolean to true to indicate that we want this text to appear instantly, not to look like it is being typed by hand. (A shell prompt isn't usually typed by a person.) Then we set `delayAfter` to introduce a half second delay before the next animation step runs.

The second step simulates the user typing "whoami" and then a new line. There is another half second delay after this step.

The third step demonstrates the use of newline characters inside typed text. The newline character will be treated just like any other character, but please keep in mind that HTML user agents won't display a new line character unless you set the CSS accordingly! (Hint: `white-space: pre;`)

The fourth step demonstrates two interesting features. First, the text includes the `\b` escape code, which is the backspace character. If you include backspaces in your string, then `Typewriter` will simulate the user typing out a string and then backspacing over it. In this case, we have included just enough backspaces to delete the `rickastley.mp4` file name and then type something else in its place.

The other interesting feature in this step is the callback. Each step can have a callback triggered after it runs. Note that the callback runs _after_ the text finishes rendering but _before_ the delay. So in this case, the `Typewriter` would spend several seconds animating the text, write to the console immediately after the text animation, then wait another 1000 milliseconds before moving onto the next step.

# Example 3: Typewriter #

[View Example 3 Demo…](https://rawgit.com/mehaase/js-typewriter/master/example3-typewriter/index.html)

At last, the eponymous example! This example introduces character callbacks: functions that are executed after each character is typed. This allows us to play an extremely annoying typewriter sound effect on each keystroke! Try not to faint with excitement.

Let's look at [example3-typewriter/index.html](./example3-typewriter/index.html).

```javascript
var carriageReturnSound = new Audio('./typewriter-carriage-return.mp3');
var keystrokeSound = new Audio('./typewriter-keystroke.mp3');

function playSound (character) {
    carriageReturnSound.pause();
    keystrokeSound.pause();

    if (character == "\n") {
        carriageReturnSound.currentTime = 0;
        carriageReturnSound.play();
    } else if (character != " ") {
        keystrokeSound.currentTime = 0;
        keystrokeSound.play();
    }
}

$(function () {
    var typewriter = new Typewriter($("#typewriter"));
    typewriter.setCaret("");
    typewriter.setCaretPeriod(0);
    typewriter.setDelay(500, 100);
    typewriter.setCharacterCallback(playSound);
    animate(typewriter);
});
```

We begin by loading two sound files. We define a callback called `playSound` that will inspect the character being displayed and play an appropriate sound. If the character is a newline, then we'll play a carriage return sound. If the character is a space, then we won't play any sound – slightly decreasing how annoying this demo is – and if it's any other character, we play a keystroke sound.

Then we create our `Typewriter` instance. This time, we set the caret to a blank string and disable caret flashing by setting its period to zero.

Finally, we install the `playSound` callback and then call our `animate()` function.

Let's take a look at how animate works. You'll find the source code in [example3-typewriter/animate.js](./example3-typewriter/animate.js).

```javascript
var poem = [
    "O Me! O Life!\n",
    "by Walt Whitman (1892)\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,\n",
    "Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill'd with the foolish,\n",
    "Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)\n",
    "Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,\n",
    "Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,\n",
    "Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,\n",
    "The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?\n",
    "\n",
    "       Answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "That you are here—that life exists and identity,\n",
    "That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.\n"
];

function animate(typewriter) {
    sequence = [];

    for (var i in poem) {
        sequence.push({
            text: poem[i],
            delayAfter: 1500,
        });
    }

    typewriter.playSequence(sequence);
}
```

In contrast to example 2, we have greatly simplified our animation sequence in this step by writing out our text as an array of strings, then iterating over that array. After each line of text is typed, we delay for 1.5 seconds.
